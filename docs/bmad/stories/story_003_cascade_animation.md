As a player I want to see realistic falling and refill animations after matches are cleared, so that I can understand how the board is being updated and follow the cascade mechanics.

✅ **COMPLETED - Implementation Status**:
This story has been fully implemented with **Phaser.js physics-based animations and particle effects**.

**Acceptance Criteria** (✅ All Completed):
- ✅ **Realistic Physics**: Tiles fall with proper gravity using "Bounce.easeOut" for natural settling
- ✅ **Smooth Transitions**: Each tile smoothly animates from origin to destination with Phaser.js tweening
- ✅ **Dynamic Timing**: Animation duration scales with distance (400-600ms) for realistic physics
- ✅ **Proper Acceleration**: Physics-based easing with acceleration and natural deceleration
- ✅ **Spawn Animations**: New tiles drop from above visible area with smooth entry animations
- ✅ **Connected Physics**: Spawn animations perfectly sync with falling tile system
- ✅ **Multi-level Cascades**: Automatic loop until no matches remain (up to 1.5x multiplier)
- ✅ **Input Blocking**: `PhaserAnimator.isAnimating()` prevents input during sequences
- ✅ **Clear Visual Flow**: Particle effects → fall animation → spawn → match check → repeat
- ✅ **60fps Performance**: Hardware-accelerated WebGL with consistent frame rates
- ✅ **Tile Tracking**: Individual sprites maintain visual continuity throughout animation
- ✅ **State Consistency**: Board state perfectly synchronized with visual representation

**Implementation Details**:
- **Particle Effects**: Colorful burst particles on tile clearing with tint variations
- **Physics Animation**: `PhaserAnimator.animateFallingTiles()` with realistic bounce physics
- **Spawn System**: `PhaserAnimator.animateSpawningTiles()` creates new sprites with drop animations
- **Cascade Management**: `startSequentialCascade()` orchestrates complete animation sequences
- **Performance**: Hardware acceleration ensures smooth 60fps with multiple simultaneous animations

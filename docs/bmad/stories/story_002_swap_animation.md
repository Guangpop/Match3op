As a player I want to see smooth animations when tiles swap, so that I can clearly understand what is happening on the board.

✅ **COMPLETED - Implementation Status**:
This story has been fully implemented using **Phaser.js hardware-accelerated animations**.

**Acceptance Criteria** (✅ All Completed):
- ✅ **Smooth Movement**: Tiles use Phaser.js tweening for buttery-smooth position transitions
- ✅ **Optimal Timing**: Animations complete in 300-400ms with configurable easing curves
- ✅ **Animation Blocking**: PhaserAnimator prevents simultaneous swaps during animations
- ✅ **Invalid Swap Handling**: Failed swaps smoothly revert with "Back.easeIn" animation
- ✅ **Valid Swap Flow**: Successful swaps proceed seamlessly to match clearing effects
- ✅ **Performance Excellence**: Hardware-accelerated 60fps with WebGL rendering

**Implementation Details**:
- **Animation System**: `PhaserAnimator.startSwapAnimation()` with Phaser.js tweening
- **Easing Effects**: "Back.easeOut" for forward swaps, "Back.easeIn" for reverts
- **State Management**: `isAnimating()` prevents input during transitions
- **Visual Polish**: Smooth sprite interpolation with sub-pixel positioning

# Match-3 Game Architecture Document

## 🏗 System Overview
The game is implemented as a web-based application that runs inside a WebView using **Phaser.js 3.80** game engine. 
It uses TypeScript for type-safe game logic and Phaser.js for hardware-accelerated WebGL/Canvas rendering with particle effects.

## 🔑 Core Modules

### 1. Board Manager (`src/core/board.ts`)
- Initializes the 8x8 grid with 5 colored tile types
- Ensures no pre-existing matches at game start
- Provides tile swapping and validation functions
- Maintains grid state and tile positioning

### 2. Match Engine (`src/core/match.ts`)
- Detects horizontal and vertical matches (3+ consecutive tiles)
- Clears matched tiles and calculates base scores (10 points per tile)
- Provides match preview for swap validation
- Supports complex match patterns and combinations

### 3. Cascade System (`src/core/cascade.ts`)
- Implements realistic physics for tile falling with gravity
- Handles tile refilling from the top with new random tiles
- Calculates cascade steps for smooth animations
- Manages multi-level cascades with 1.5x score multipliers

### 4. Phaser Game Controller (`src/core/phaser-game.ts`)
- Orchestrates the complete game flow with Phaser.js integration
- Manages game state, score tracking, and cascade processing
- Coordinates between game logic and Phaser.js animations
- Handles async animation sequences and timing

### 5. Phaser Renderer (`src/ui/phaser-renderer.ts`)
- **Match3Scene**: Main Phaser.js scene managing game objects
- Handles user input (mouse/touch) with tile selection
- Creates and manages Phaser.js sprites for tiles
- Integrates with PhaserAnimator for smooth effects

### 6. Phaser Animator (`src/ui/phaser-animator.ts`)
- **Hardware-accelerated animations** using Phaser.js tweening
- Particle effects for tile clearing with colorful bursts
- Realistic physics for falling tiles with bounce effects
- Smooth spawn animations for new tiles dropping from above
- Non-blocking async animation system for 60fps performance

## 📱 Platform Considerations
- **WebView Optimized**: Full compatibility with iOS Safari WebView and Android Chrome WebView
- **Hardware Acceleration**: WebGL rendering with Canvas fallback for maximum performance
- **Responsive Design**: Automatic scaling for different screen sizes and orientations
- **Touch Input**: Native touch gesture support with mouse fallback
- **Performance**: Phaser.js optimizations for consistent 60 FPS on mobile devices
- **Memory Management**: Efficient sprite pooling and texture management

---

## 🔮 Future Extensions
- **Special Tiles**: Bomb tiles, striped tiles, rainbow tiles with unique effects
- **Level System**: Progressive difficulty with goals and objectives  
- **Audio System**: Phaser.js audio manager for sound effects and background music
- **Save/Load**: Local storage integration for game state persistence
- **Advanced Particles**: Enhanced visual effects and celebration animations
- **Power-ups**: Special abilities and boosters for enhanced gameplay
- **Achievements**: Unlockable rewards and milestone tracking

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- **Architecture**: Clear separation between core game logic and Phaser.js rendering layer
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for board, match engine, and cascade systems
- **Performance**: Consistent 60 FPS with hardware-accelerated animations
- **Compatibility**: Flawless operation in iOS/Android WebView environments
- **Visual Quality**: Professional-grade animations with particle effects and physics
- **User Experience**: Intuitive touch controls with immediate visual feedback
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode with full type safety and documentation
